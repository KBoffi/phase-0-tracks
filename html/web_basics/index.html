  <h1>The CUD Scale</h1>
  <p>The CUD scale is a rubric for rating beer and sharing your subjective evaluations with friends. The rating for each beer consists of three factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Craftsmanship</li>
    <li>Uniqueness</li>
    <li>Drinkability</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Craftsmanship</strong> is rated out of 4:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The beer lacks intention or followthrough.</li>
    <li>The beer missed the mark.</li>
    <li>The beer does what is intended.</li>
    <li>This beer transcends its category.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Uniqueness</strong> is rated from 0 to 2:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>0 = This beer is not unique.</li>
    <li>1 = This beer stands out.</li>
    <li>2 = I will not forget this beer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Drinkability</strong> is rated out of 4:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I had some, and I don't need any more.</li>
    <li>I drank it and I'm content.</li>
    <li>I drank it and I would have it again.</li>
    <li>I would have this beer again and again.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The CUD scale was invented in Montana and is an allusion to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cud"><em>cud</em></a>, or the food Montana cows bring from their first stomachs into their mouths to chew again.
