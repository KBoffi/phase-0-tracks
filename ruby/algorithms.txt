Algorithm for Using an Elevator (For a Robot)

- While outside the elevator:
  - If you are traveling upward:
    - Press the button shaped like an upward arrow or the superior of two vertically aligned buttons situated along the left- or right-hand perimeter of the elevator doors
  - Otherwise:
    - Press the button shaped like a downward arrow or the inferior of two vertically aligned buttons situated along the left- or right-hand perimeter of the elevator doors
  - Wait for the corresponding button along the top perimeter of the elevator doors to illuminate 
  - After the doors open, enter the elevator
- While inside the elevator:
  - Turn 180 degrees to face the inside of the elevator doors
  - If you are traveling upward:
    - On the panel of buttons situated along the left- or right-hand perimeter of the elevator doors, press a button with an integer that has a value greater than the integer of the current floor
  - Otherwise:
    - On the panel of buttons situated along the left- or right-hand perimeter of the elevator doors, press a button with an integer that has a value less than the integer of the current floor
  - After doors close, wait for movement to stop
  - After the doors open, exit the elevator


  Algorithm for Making a Cup of Tea 

- Remove the tea kettle from the heating element  
- While holding the kettle in your left hand:
  - Move right in a straight line parallel to the counter where the heating element is until the corner of the counter is reached
  - Rotate right 90 degrees and move right in a straight line parallel to the counter where the sink is 
  - When you reach the sink, stop
  - Remove the lid from the tea kettle and place it on the counter to the right of the sink
  - While the tea kettle is under the sink faucet:
    - Use your right hand to turn the right-hand knob to the right to start water flowing
    - Fill the tea kettle to the line on the inside of the kettle directly across from the spout
    - Use your right hand to turn the right-hand knob to the left to stop water flowing
  - Replace the lid on the tea kettle 
  - Move left in a straight line parallel to the counter where the sink is until the corner of the counter is reached
  - Rotate 90 degrees and move left in a straight line parallel to the counter where the heating element is 
  - When you reach the heating element, stop
  - Place the kettle on top of the heating element
- Press the button on the heating element with the string “on”
- While the water is heating:
  - Open the cabinet directly above the kettle 
  - Remove a mug and place it on the counter in front of the kettle
  - Open the box on the counter next to the kettle
  - Remove a single teabag and place it in the mug
- If temperature reads 200 on the heating element:
  - Remove the kettle from the heating element
  - Place the spout directly above the mug and turn the kettle downward 
  - When the cup is full of water, turn the kettle upward
  - Return kettle to the heating element
