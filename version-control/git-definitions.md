# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows you to create, save, and revert or refer back to previous versions of code. Because you can view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, you can always roll back a doc to any point in the timeline, thus preserving code. Version control also lets multiple people work on a project simultaneously without stepping on each others' toes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the original code base that you can use to work on individual projects. You use branches when you want to add features or make changes to existing projects. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point and occurs after changes have been made to code in a text editor and then staged. Good commit messages are detailed and clearly indicate what changes were made before they were committed. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two people make competing changes to the same line of code in a file, or when someone makes changes to a file that was deleted.
