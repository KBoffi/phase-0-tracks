## 9.1 How the Web Works 

1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux was designed on the premise that the user knows what he or she is doing. The primary goal of the OS is not to prevent users from doing stupid things, because that would compromise their ability to do clever things. 

There are 9 major design philosophies of the Linux OS:

1) Small is Beautiful
2) Each Program Does One Thing Well
These two tenets converge. --Commands are short, efficient, and are associated with one discrete task. 

3) Prototype as Soon as Possible

4) Choose Portability Over Efficiency
5) Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Portability refers to the idea of running (or updating) the same program on a variety of systems. 

6) Store Data in Flat Text Files

7) Use Software Leverage
Leverage the work of programmers who have already developed solutions for various problems. 

8) Avoid Captive User Interfaces

9) Make Every Program a Filter

The concept of filters has to do with standard input and standard output (STDIO). THe program or command takes an input, modifies the data in some way, and returns the data as an output. 


2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A virtual private server is a virtual machine that mimics the functionality of a physical web server, but with potentially lower performance. Virtual private servers are provided by hosting services for a fee. Superusers have full access to the OS and can install software of their choice. 

Using virtual private servers heightens security, as VPSes are often isolated from each other. 

Using a VPS is also a good choice if you've run out of space on a hosting plan or if you want to experiment with new applications and make your server more flexible without incurring the costs of a dedicated server.
