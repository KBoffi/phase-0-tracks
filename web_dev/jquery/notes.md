9.3 jQuery 

Release 0 

Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

RESOURCES:

"JavaScript & JQuery" by Jon Duckett
(I plan to spend the majority of my time with this book, as I found his HTML & CSS book more helpful than any HTML/CSS resources I found online and I assume this one will be equally clear and illustrative.)

Supplemental --

(long video, good to skip through once topics have been covered elsewhere)

SELF-TESTING:

I plan to hold off on testing, instead getting through the material and taking notes that can guide me once I am ready to start building my project. 

BREAKS:

I plan to take one 10-min. break every hour.
